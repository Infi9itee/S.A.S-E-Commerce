**Here's the things you need to do in order to compile and run the game:**
**Things needed before compiling:**
1. MinGW-w64 compiler.
2. The game has graphical interface, so in order to run the game you need to install WSL. I installed (Ubuntu).
3. Im using WSL so need to install ncurses.
4. Install make via MinGW or MSYS2.
5. Any code editor.
6. Windows.

**Compiling the Game:**
1. Open WSL terminal.
2. Nevigate to the project directory. (Where all the game files are).
3. Run **make** command in the WSL terminal.

**Running the Game:**
1. Start the game by running ./multiplication_game in the WSL terminal.
2. Use your keyboard to interact with menus, input factors and nevigate the game.
3. Press 'q' during game to return to main menu and in main menu select the exit option to stop running the game.

**Important:**
**The game has save functionality. So make sure to place the game files in a directory where you have write permission. Cause it needs to write multiplication_save.txt.**
